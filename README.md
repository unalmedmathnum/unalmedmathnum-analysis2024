## Numerical Analysis Course Codes
Welcome to the Numerical Analysis Course Codes repository! 
This repository contains (almost) all the code examples, scripts, and computational exercises 
corresponding to the lectures in the numerical analysis course.

## Requirements
All codes are written in Python. To run the scripts, you will need Python 3.9 (at least) and the following libraries:

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
pandas 

You can install all dependencies with:

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/unalmedmathnum/unalmedmathnum-analysis2024/
```
